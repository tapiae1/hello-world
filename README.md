Repository for Code Louisville

This repo is from the Github tutorial in the Code: Louisville program. 
My name is Eduardo and I am very excited to continue the program! Hopefully this is just the very beginning of me achieving my dream of landing a job in software engineering market! I fell in love with the programming world when I decided to go into the Computer Science department at Berea College.
